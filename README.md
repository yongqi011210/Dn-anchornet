# Dn-anchornet
This repository contains the official implementation of the DN-AnchorNet framework proposed in our paper, which addresses the challenges of small target detection in SAR imagery by jointly modeling denoising and anchor adaptation.

ðŸ“Œ Project Overview


This project is based on mmrotate and proposes a set of integrated improvements for ship detection in SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) images, tackling challenges such as small object detection, noise interference, and diverse object scales/orientations:

âœ… Structure-aware Denoising Module (DenoisingHead): Suppresses SAR-specific noise while preserving target contours;

âœ… Scale-Adaptive Anchor Generator (AdaptiveAnchorGenerator): Improves coverage for small and irregular targets;

âœ… Adaptive Weighted Regression Loss (AdaptiveSmoothL1Loss): Enhances robustness for difficult regression samples.
